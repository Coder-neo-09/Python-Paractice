# 🐍 3. Variables & Data Types

---

Variables are **named storage locations** used to hold data.
Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning you don’t need to declare the type explicitly — Python infers it.

---

## 🧩 1. Variables

* A variable is created the moment you assign a value.
* Naming rules:

  * Must start with a letter or `_`
  * Can’t start with a number
  * Case-sensitive (`age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are different)
  * Use snake\_case convention (`user_name`)

✅ Example:

```python
x = 10
name = "Alice"
is_active = True
```

## 🧩 2. Data Types in Python

Python has several built-in types.

| Type       | Example               |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| `int`      | `10`, `-5`            |
| `float`    | `3.14`, `-2.7`        |
| `str`      | `"Hello"`, `'Python'` |
| `bool`     | `True`, `False`       |
| `list`     | `[1, 2, 3]`           |
| `tuple`    | `(1, 2, 3)`           |
| `set`      | `{1, 2, 3}`           |
| `dict`     | `{"a": 1, "b": 2}`    |
| `NoneType` | `None`                |

## 🧩 3. Type Checking

Use `type()` to check variable type:

```python
x = 42
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>

y = 3.14
print(type(y))  # <class 'float'>

z = "Hello"
print(type(z))  # <class 'str'>
```

## 🧪 Example: Using Variables

```python
# Student info program

name = "Rahul"
age = 20
cgpa = 8.7
is_passed = True

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("CGPA:", cgpa)
print("Passed:", is_passed)
```

## 📚 Real-World Mini Project: **Simple Profile Card**

```python
# Profile Card Example

name = "Ananya"
age = 22
city = "Hyderabad"
skills = ["Python", "SQL", "HTML"]

print("---- PROFILE CARD ----")
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("City:", city)
print("Skills:", skills)
```

✅ Demonstrates **variables + multiple data types** in action.

---

## ✅ Summary

* Variables store data, no explicit declaration needed.
* Python has multiple built-in data types.
* `type()` helps check what type of value a variable holds.
