# 🐍 2. Python Syntax, Indentation, and Comments

---

Python’s syntax is designed to be **clean, readable, and beginner-friendly**. Unlike many languages, Python uses **indentation** instead of braces `{}` to define code blocks, and allows comments for clarity.

---

## 🧩 1. Python Syntax Basics

* Python code runs **line by line** (interpreted).
* Each statement is usually on a new line.
* No need for semicolons (`;`) at the end of lines (optional).

✅ Example:

```python
x = 10
y = 20
print(x + y)  # Output: 30
```

---

## 📏 2. Indentation

Indentation = spaces at the beginning of a line.

* Required in Python to define **blocks of code** (loops, functions, classes).
* Standard = **4 spaces** per level (never mix tabs & spaces).

✅ Example:

```python
if True:
    print("Indented block runs")
    print("This is inside the if")

print("This is outside the if")
```

❌ Wrong (IndentationError):

```python
if True:
print("This will cause an error")
```

## 💬 3. Comments

Comments are ignored by Python, used for explanations.

### (a) Single-line comments:

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello")  # Inline comment
```

### (b) Multi-line comments (by convention with triple quotes):

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment
It won’t run as code
"""
print("Python ignores comments")
```

## 🧪 Example: Indentation & Comments

```python
# Program to check number sign
num = -5

if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif num == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    # Indented block for negative numbers
    print("Negative number")
```

## 📚 Real-World Mini Project: Simple Grading Script

```python
# Student Grading Example

score = 85  # Student's marks

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 50:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")  # Fail case
```

## ✅ Summary

| Concept        | Description                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Syntax         | Clean, readable, no semicolons needed     |
| Indentation    | Defines blocks (4 spaces recommended)     |
| Comments       | `#` for single-line, `"""` for multi-line |
| Error Handling | Wrong indentation → `IndentationError`    |
