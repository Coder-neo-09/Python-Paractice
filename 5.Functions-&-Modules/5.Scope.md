# 🌍 5 Scope (Local, Global, Nonlocal Variables)

**Scope** refers to **where a variable can be accessed** inside your program.
Python follows the **LEGB rule**:

1. **L – Local** → Inside the current function
2. **E – Enclosing** → Inside nested (outer) functions
3. **G – Global** → At the top level of the program
4. **B – Built-in** → Predefined names in Python (e.g., `print`, `len`)

## 📌 1. Local Variables

Defined **inside a function** → accessible only within it.

```python
def greet():
    name = "Alice"   # local variable
    print("Hello", name)

greet()
# print(name)  # ❌ Error: name not defined
```

---

## 📌 2. Global Variables

Defined **outside all functions** → accessible anywhere in the program.

```python
x = 10  # global variable

def show():
    print("x =", x)

show()
print("Outside:", x)
```

---

## 📌 3. Modifying Global Variables

To modify a **global variable inside a function**, use the `global` keyword.

```python
count = 0

def increment():
    global count
    count += 1

increment()
print("Count =", count)  # 1
```

---

## 📌 4. Enclosing (Nonlocal) Variables

In **nested functions**, variables from the outer function can be modified using `nonlocal`.

```python
def outer():
    x = "outer"
    
    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x = "modified in inner"
    
    inner()
    print(x)

outer()   # modified in inner
```

---

## 🧪 Example: Global vs Local

```python
x = 50

def func():
    x = 20
    print("Local x:", x)

func()
print("Global x:", x)
```

✅ Output:

```text
Local x: 20  
Global x: 50
```

## 🎯 Mini Project: Counter Function

👉 Create a counter that remembers how many times it has been called.

```python
def counter():
    count = 0
    
    def inner():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    
    return inner

c = counter()
print(c())  # 1
print(c())  # 2
print(c())  # 3
```

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Use **local variables** whenever possible (clean & safe)
* Minimize use of `global` (can make debugging harder)
* Use `nonlocal` only for nested function cases
* Follow **LEGB rule** to resolve variable conflicts
