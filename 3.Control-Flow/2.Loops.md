# 🔁 3.2 Loops (`for`, `while`)

Loops allow you to **repeat tasks** without writing the same code multiple times.
Python provides two main types of loops: **`for`** and **`while`**.

---

## 🔄 The `for` Loop

Used to **iterate over a sequence** (list, string, tuple, range, etc.).

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

👉 Output:

```
apple
banana
cherry
```

---

### ✅ Using `range()` in `for` loops

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

👉 Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

```python
for i in range(2, 10, 2):  # start=2, stop=10, step=2
    print(i)
```

👉 Output:

```
2
4
6
8
```

---

## 🔁 The `while` Loop

Repeats as long as a condition is `True`.

```python
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
```

👉 Output:

```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

⚠️ Be careful → **infinite loops** happen if the condition never becomes `False`.

---

## 🧪 Nested Loops

Loops inside loops.

```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
```

---

## 🧩 Loop with `else`

The `else` block runs if the loop completes **without `break`**.

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished successfully")
```

## 🎯 Mini Project: Multiplication Table Generator

👉 Write a program that asks for a number and prints its multiplication table (1–10).

**Example Run:**

```text
Enter a number: 5
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
...
5 x 10 = 50
```

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Use `for` when iterating over a **known sequence**
* Use `while` when repeating until a **condition changes**
* Always update conditions inside `while` loops to avoid infinite loops
