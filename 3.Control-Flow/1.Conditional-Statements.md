# 🔀 3.1 Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)

Conditional statements allow your program to **make decisions** based on conditions.
They control which block of code gets executed.

---

## ✅ The `if` Statement

Runs a block only if the condition is `True`.

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
```

---

## 🔄 The `if … else` Statement

Provides an **alternative path** when the condition is `False`.

```python
age = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

---

## 🔁 The `if … elif … else` Chain

Used for **multiple conditions**.

```python
marks = 75
if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 50:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

---

## 🧪 Nested `if` Statements

Conditions **inside other conditions**.

```python
x = 10
if x > 0:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        print("Positive even number")
```

---

## 🧩 One-Line Conditional (Ternary Operator)

A shorthand form of `if … else`.

```python
age = 20
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(status)  # Adult
```

## 🎯 Mini Project: Simple Voting Eligibility Checker

👉 Write a program that:

1. Asks the user for their age
2. If `age >= 18`, print `"Eligible to vote"`
3. Else, print `"Not eligible to vote"`

**Example Run:**

```text
Enter your age: 21
You are eligible to vote!
```

```text
Enter your age: 16
Sorry, you are not eligible to vote.
```

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Use **`elif`** instead of multiple `if` for mutually exclusive cases
* Keep conditions simple and readable
* Use **ternary operators** for short, one-line decisions
