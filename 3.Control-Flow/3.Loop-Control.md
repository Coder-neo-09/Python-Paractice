# ⏹️ 3.3 Loop Control (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)

Sometimes you don’t want a loop to run fully from start to end.
Python gives special **control statements** to manage loop execution.

---

## ⛔ `break` → Exit the Loop Immediately

Ends the loop, even if the condition or sequence is not finished.

```python
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

👉 Output:

```
1
2
3
4
```

---

## 🔄 `continue` → Skip Current Iteration

Skips the rest of the code **for that iteration**, then goes to the next one.

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```

👉 Output:

```
1
2
4
5
```

---

## 📝 `pass` → Do Nothing (Placeholder)

Used when a statement is required syntactically but you don’t want to write code yet.

```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    if i == 2:
        pass   # placeholder for future logic
    else:
        print(i)
```

👉 Output:

```
1
3
```

---

## 🧪 Combining with `while`

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    count += 1
    if count == 3:
        continue
    if count == 4:
        break
    print(count)
```

👉 Output:

```
1
2
```

## 🎯 Mini Project: Number Guessing Game (Simple)

👉 Write a program that:

1. Picks a secret number (e.g., `7`)
2. Lets the user guess in a loop
3. If guess is wrong, continue asking
4. If guess is correct, break and show success

**Example Run:**

```text
Guess the number: 5
Wrong! Try again.
Guess the number: 7
🎉 Correct! You guessed it!
```

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Use `break` for **early exit** when condition is met
* Use `continue` to **skip unwanted cases**
* Use `pass` as a **placeholder** when planning code
