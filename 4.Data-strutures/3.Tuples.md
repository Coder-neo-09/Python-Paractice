# 🎯 4.3 Tuples (Immutable Sequences)

A **tuple** is like a **list**, but it is **immutable** → once created, it **cannot be changed**.
They are used for **fixed collections of data** (e.g., coordinates, database records).

## 📝 Creating Tuples

```python
# Different ways to create tuples
t1 = (1, 2, 3)
t2 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
t3 = (1, "hello", 3.14, True)
t4 = tuple([10, 20, 30])   # from list

single = (5,)   # IMPORTANT: single-element tuple needs a comma
```

✅ Tuples use **parentheses `( )`** instead of square brackets.

## 🔄 Tuple Operations

### Accessing Items (Indexing)

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits[0])     # apple
print(fruits[-1])    # cherry
```

### Slicing Tuples

```python
nums = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
print(nums[1:4])   # (20, 30, 40)
print(nums[:3])    # (10, 20, 30)
```

---

## ⚡ Immutability

```python
t = (1, 2, 3)
# t[0] = 99   ❌ ERROR: Tuples cannot be modified
```

If you need to modify → convert to list:

```python
t = (1, 2, 3)
lst = list(t)
lst.append(4)
t = tuple(lst)
print(t)   # (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

---

## 🔧 Useful Tuple Methods

```python
nums = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4)

print(len(nums))       # 5
print(nums.count(2))   # 2
print(nums.index(3))   # 3 (position of first 3)
```

---

## 🔍 Tuple Packing & Unpacking

```python
# Packing
person = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")

# Unpacking
name, age, job = person
print(name)  # Alice
print(age)   # 25
```

---

## 🧪 Nested Tuples

```python
nested = (("a", 1), ("b", 2))
print(nested[1][0])   # b
```

---

## 🎯 Mini Project: Student Record Storage

👉 Store a student’s data (name, age, grade) in a tuple.
Then unpack and display the details.

**Example Run:**

```text
Student: Alice
Age: 20
Grade: A
```

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Use **tuples for fixed data** that shouldn’t change
* Prefer **lists** if frequent modifications are required
* Tuples can be used as **dictionary keys**, but lists cannot

```python
coordinates = {(10, 20): "Point A", (30, 40): "Point B"}
print(coordinates[(10, 20)])   # Point A
```
