# 🛡️ 7.3 `finally` & `else` in Python Exceptions

When handling errors, sometimes you want code to **always run** (cleanup, closing files, etc.) or code that runs **only if no error happens**. That’s where `finally` and `else` help.

## 🔑 Structure

```python
try:
    # risky code
except SomeError:
    # handle error
else:
    # runs only if NO error occurs
finally:
    # always runs, error or not
```

---

## ✅ Example 1: Using `finally`

```python
try:
    f = open("data.txt", "w")
    f.write("Hello")
except Exception as e:
    print("Error:", e)
finally:
    f.close()  # always closes file
    print("File closed safely.")
```

👉 Output:

```
File closed safely.
```

Even if an error happens, the file will close.

---

## ✅ Example 2: Using `else`

```python
try:
    num = int("42")
except ValueError:
    print("Conversion failed!")
else:
    print("Conversion successful:", num)
```

👉 Output:

```
Conversion successful: 42
```

---

## ✅ Example 3: `try + except + else + finally`

```python
try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("❌ Invalid input")
else:
    print("✅ Number is", x)
finally:
    print("🔒 Execution complete")
```

## 🎯 Mini Project: File Reader with Cleanup

```python
def read_file(filename):
    try:
        f = open(filename, "r")
        content = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("❌ File not found!")
    else:
        print("📄 File content:\n", content)
    finally:
        try:
            f.close()
            print("🔒 File closed.")
        except:
            pass  # if file was never opened

read_file("example.txt")
```

✅ Safely handles file reading, errors, and ensures closing.
