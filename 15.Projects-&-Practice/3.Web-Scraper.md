# 🌐 Project: Python Web Scraper

We’ll build a scraper that fetches **article titles** from a website (e.g., blog, news site).

---

## 📂 1. Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

---

## 📝 2. Code

```python
# web_scraper.py
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_titles(url):
    # Send HTTP request
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print("Failed to retrieve page ❌")
        return []

    # Parse HTML
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

    # Extract article titles (example: <h2> tags with class 'title')
    titles = [h2.get_text(strip=True) for h2 in soup.find_all("h2")]

    return titles

def main():
    url = "https://realpython.com/"   # Example site
    print(f"Scraping titles from: {url}\n")

    titles = scrape_titles(url)

    if not titles:
        print("No titles found.")
    else:
        for i, title in enumerate(titles, start=1):
            print(f"{i}. {title}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

⚡ Extension Ideas:

* Save scraped data into a **CSV file**
* Scrape **multiple pages** with a loop
* Build a **CLI tool** where users enter any URL
