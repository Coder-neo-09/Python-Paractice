# 🏗️ 8.2 Attributes & Methods

In OOP, **attributes** store data about an object, and **methods** define its behavior.

---

## 📌 1. Instance Attributes

* Belong to **specific objects**
* Defined inside `__init__` using `self`

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, color):
        self.brand = brand
        self.color = color

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Red")
print(my_car.brand)  # Toyota
print(my_car.color)  # Red
```

---

## 📌 2. Class Attributes

* Shared by **all objects** of the class
* Defined directly inside the class, outside `__init__`

```python
class Car:
    wheels = 4  # Class attribute

car1 = Car()
car2 = Car()
print(car1.wheels)  # 4
print(car2.wheels)  # 4
```

---

## 📌 3. Instance Methods

* Functions that act on **object attributes**
* Defined using `def` inside class, first parameter is `self`

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

    def start(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} is starting 🚗")

car = Car("Honda")
car.start()  # Honda is starting 🚗
```

---

## 📌 4. Class Methods

* Defined with `@classmethod` decorator
* First parameter is `cls` → refers to the class itself

```python
class Car:
    wheels = 4

    @classmethod
    def info(cls):
        print(f"All cars have {cls.wheels} wheels.")

Car.info()  # All cars have 4 wheels
```

---

## 📌 5. Static Methods

* Defined with `@staticmethod` decorator
* Don’t take `self` or `cls`
* Utility functions related to the class

```python
class Car:
    @staticmethod
    def honk():
        print("Beep Beep!")

Car.honk()  # Beep Beep!
```

## 🎯 Mini Project: Library Book Tracker

```python
class Book:
    total_books = 0  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        Book.total_books += 1

    def info(self):
        print(f"'{self.title}' by {self.author}")

    @classmethod
    def total(cls):
        print(f"Total books in library: {cls.total_books}")

# Test
b1 = Book("1984", "George Orwell")
b2 = Book("Python Basics", "Ramya")

b1.info()
b2.info()
Book.total()
```

✅ Output:

```
'1984' by George Orwell
'Python Basics' by Ramya
Total books in library: 2
```

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Use **instance attributes** for object-specific data
* Use **class attributes** for shared data
* Use **instance methods** to manipulate object data
* Use **class/staticmethods** for utilities or class-level operations
