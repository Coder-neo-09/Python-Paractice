# 🔍 2.3 Identity & Membership Operators

Python provides special operators to check:

* **Identity** → Whether two objects are the **same in memory**
* **Membership** → Whether a value exists **inside a sequence or collection**

---

## 🆔 Identity Operators (`is`, `is not`)

They compare **object identity**, not just value.

| Operator | Meaning                                | Example (`a=5, b=5`) | Result |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| `is`     | True if both refer to **same object**  | `a is b`             | True   |
| `is not` | True if they are **different objects** | `a is not b`         | False  |

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]

print(a == b)   # True  (same contents)
print(a is b)   # False (different memory locations)

c = a
print(a is c)   # True (points to the same object)
```

✅ Use `==` for **value equality**, `is` for **object identity**.

## 📦 Membership Operators (`in`, `not in`)

They check whether an element exists in a sequence (list, string, tuple, set, dictionary).

| Operator | Meaning                        | Example              | Result |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------ |
| `in`     | True if element exists         | `"a" in "apple"`     | True   |
| `not in` | True if element does not exist | `"z" not in "apple"` | True   |

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print("apple" in fruits)      # True
print("grape" not in fruits)  # True

text = "hello world"
print("world" in text)        # True
```

---

## 🧪 Combining Identity & Membership

```python
x = None
print(x is None)   # True (identity check)

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print('d' not in letters)  # True
```

## 🎯 Mini Project: Login Simulation

👉 Create a program that:

1. Stores a list of usernames → `["alice", "bob", "charlie"]`
2. Asks the user to enter a username
3. Checks if the username **exists** (`in`)
4. Uses `is` to check if input is `None`

**Example Run:**

```text
Enter username: bob
Welcome, bob!
```

```text
Enter username: david
User not found!
```

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Use `is` only for **identity checks** (`None`, `True`, `False`)
* Prefer `in` for searching lists, strings, sets, or dicts
* Avoid confusing `is` with `==` → they are different!
