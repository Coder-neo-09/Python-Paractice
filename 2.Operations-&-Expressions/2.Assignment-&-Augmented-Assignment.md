# 📝 2.2 Assignment & Augmented Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to **store values in variables**.
Augmented assignment makes updating values **shorter and cleaner**.

---

## 📥 Basic Assignment

```python
x = 10        # assigns 10 to x
name = "Ramya"
pi = 3.14
```

✅ The `=` operator stores the value on the **right-hand side** into the variable on the **left-hand side**.

## 🔄 Augmented Assignment

Instead of writing both the variable and the operation separately, Python lets you combine them.

| Operator | Meaning                 | Example (`x=10`) | Result |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| `+=`     | Add and assign          | `x += 5`         | 15     |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign     | `x -= 3`         | 7      |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign     | `x *= 2`         | 20     |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign       | `x /= 4`         | 2.5    |
| `//=`    | Floor divide and assign | `x //= 3`        | 3      |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign      | `x %= 4`         | 2      |
| `**=`    | Exponent and assign     | `x **= 3`        | 1000   |

### 🧪 Example

```python
x = 10
x += 5   # x = x + 5 → 15
x *= 2   # x = x * 2 → 30
x -= 10  # x = x - 10 → 20
print(x) # 20
```

## ⚡ Why Use Augmented Assignment?

* Shorter and cleaner
* Improves readability in loops or counters

```python
# Without augmented assignment
count = 0
count = count + 1

# With augmented assignment
count = 0
count += 1
```

## 🎯 Mini Project: Score Tracker

👉 Create a program that simulates a game score:

1. Start with a score of **0**
2. Add **10 points** for a win
3. Subtract **5 points** for a loss
4. Display final score

**Example Run:**

```text
Initial Score = 0
Win! Score = 10
Loss! Score = 5
Win! Score = 15
Final Score = 15
```

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Use augmented assignment for **counters and accumulators**
* Stick with basic `=` when assigning for the first time
* Be careful with `/=` → it always converts result to `float`
