# ðŸ“‚ 6.3 File Modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, `rb`, `wb`)

When opening files in Python with `open()`, you specify a **mode** that tells Python what you want to do with the file.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Common File Modes

| Mode   | Description        | Behavior                                             |
| ------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `"r"`  | **Read** (default) | Opens file for reading â†’ error if file doesnâ€™t exist |
| `"w"`  | **Write**          | Creates new / overwrites existing file               |
| `"a"`  | **Append**         | Opens file for writing â†’ adds new data at end        |
| `"rb"` | **Read Binary**    | Reads binary files (images, audio, etc.)             |
| `"wb"` | **Write Binary**   | Writes binary files (images, audio, etc.)            |

---

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Read Mode (`r`)

```python
with open("sample.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.read())
```

âœ… Reads file â†’ errors if file does not exist.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Write Mode (`w`)

```python
with open("notes.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("This is a new file.")
```

âœ… Creates file if not exists â†’ overwrites if it does.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Append Mode (`a`)

```python
with open("notes.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("\nThis line is appended.")
```

âœ… Adds content without deleting existing data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 4. Read Binary (`rb`)

```python
with open("image.png", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read(20)
    print(data)
```

âœ… Reads raw bytes â†’ useful for images, videos, PDFs.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 5. Write Binary (`wb`)

```python
with open("copy.png", "wb") as f:
    f.write(b"This is binary data")
```

âœ… Writes raw bytes â†’ used when saving binary files.

---

## ðŸ§ª Example: Copying an Image

```python
with open("original.png", "rb") as src:
    data = src.read()

with open("copy.png", "wb") as dest:
    dest.write(data)

print("Image copied successfully âœ…")
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Mini Project: Journal Logger

ðŸ‘‰ A program that logs daily entries using append mode.

```python
def write_entry(text):
    with open("journal.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write(text + "\n")

def read_entries():
    with open("journal.txt", "r") as f:
        return f.read()

write_entry("Day 1: Started learning File Modes")
write_entry("Day 2: Practiced Append and Write")
print("Journal:\n", read_entries())
```

âœ… Output:

```
Journal:
Day 1: Started learning File Modes
Day 2: Practiced Append and Write
```

## ðŸ§  Best Practices

* Use **`r`** if you only want to read
* Use **`w`** carefully â†’ it overwrites existing content
* Use **`a`** to add data without losing previous entries
* Use **binary modes** (`rb`, `wb`) for images, PDFs, media
