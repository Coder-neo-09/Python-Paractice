# ✍️ 6.2 Reading & Writing (`read()`, `write()`, `with`)

Once a file is opened, we use built-in methods like **`read()`**, **`write()`**, and **`with`** to handle file data efficiently.

---

## 📌 1. Reading a File

### Read Entire File

```python
with open("sample.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)
```

✅ Reads the whole file as a string.

---

### Read Line by Line

```python
with open("sample.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())
```

✅ Iterates over lines one by one.

---

### Read All Lines into a List

```python
with open("sample.txt", "r") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    print(lines)
```

✅ Stores each line as an element in a list.

---

## 📌 2. Writing to a File

```python
with open("notes.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("First Note\n")
    f.write("Second Note\n")
```

✅ Overwrites if the file already exists.

---

## 📌 3. Appending to a File

```python
with open("notes.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("Third Note (appended)\n")
```

✅ Adds new text at the end without deleting old content.

---

## 📌 4. Using `with` (Best Practice)

The `with` statement:

* Automatically opens and closes the file
* Safer than `open()` + `close()`

```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.read())
```

## 📌 5. File Modes Recap

| Mode   | Action            | Example                 |
| ------ | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| `"r"`  | Read (default)    | `open("file.txt", "r")` |
| `"w"`  | Write (overwrite) | `open("file.txt", "w")` |
| `"a"`  | Append            | `open("file.txt", "a")` |
| `"rb"` | Read binary       | `open("img.png", "rb")` |
| `"wb"` | Write binary      | `open("img.png", "wb")` |

---

## 🧪 Example: Copy File Content

```python
with open("source.txt", "r") as src:
    content = src.read()

with open("destination.txt", "w") as dest:
    dest.write(content)

print("File copied successfully ✅")
```

## 🎯 Mini Project: To-Do List Saver

👉 A simple program to **add tasks** and **view all tasks**.

```python
def add_task(task):
    with open("tasks.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write(task + "\n")

def show_tasks():
    with open("tasks.txt", "r") as f:
        tasks = f.readlines()
        for i, task in enumerate(tasks, 1):
            print(f"{i}. {task.strip()}")

add_task("Learn Python File Handling")
add_task("Complete homework")
show_tasks()
```

✅ Output:

```
1. Learn Python File Handling
2. Complete homework
```

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Use `with open()` → safer, auto-closes file
* Always handle files in **text mode** unless working with media → then use binary mode
* Prefer `readline()` or iteration for large files instead of `read()`
