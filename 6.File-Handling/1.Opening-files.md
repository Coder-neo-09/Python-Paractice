# ðŸ“‚ 6.1 Opening Files in Python

Python provides the built-in `open()` function to **work with files**.
You can **read**, **write**, or **append** data in files using different modes.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Syntax

```python
file = open("filename", "mode")
# work with the file
file.close()
```

* `"filename"` â†’ name or path of the file
* `"mode"` â†’ tells Python what you want to do with the file

---

## ðŸ“Œ Common File Modes

| Mode   | Meaning                                      | Example                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `"r"`  | Read (default) â€“ error if file doesnâ€™t exist | `open("data.txt", "r")`    |
| `"w"`  | Write â€“ creates new / overwrites file        | `open("data.txt", "w")`    |
| `"a"`  | Append â€“ adds data at end                    | `open("data.txt", "a")`    |
| `"rb"` | Read in binary mode                          | `open("image.png", "rb")`  |
| `"wb"` | Write in binary mode                         | `open("output.png", "wb")` |

## ðŸ“Œ Example: Reading a File

```python
file = open("sample.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()
```

âœ… Opens `sample.txt`, reads all content, then closes the file.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Example: Writing to a File

```python
file = open("notes.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello, this is my first note!\n")
file.close()
```

âœ… Creates/overwrites `notes.txt`.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Example: Appending to a File

```python
file = open("notes.txt", "a")
file.write("Adding another line.\n")
file.close()
```

âœ… Adds new text without deleting old content.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Using `with` (Better Practice)

```python
with open("sample.txt", "r") as f:
    data = f.read()
    print(data)
```

âœ… Automatically closes the file after use.

---

## ðŸ§ª Example: Writing & Reading Back

```python
with open("hello.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Python File Handling Example")

with open("hello.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.read())
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Mini Project: Simple Note Saver

ðŸ‘‰ A program that lets users save and read notes.

```python
def save_note(text):
    with open("mynotes.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write(text + "\n")

def read_notes():
    with open("mynotes.txt", "r") as f:
        return f.read()

save_note("Buy milk")
save_note("Finish Python homework")

print("Your Notes:\n", read_notes())
```

âœ… Output:

```
Your Notes:
Buy milk
Finish Python homework
```

---

## ðŸ§  Best Practices

* Always close files â†’ or use `with open()`
* Use `"a"` instead of `"w"` if you donâ€™t want to lose data
* For large files â†’ read line by line (`for line in f`)
* Use binary mode (`rb`, `wb`) for images, PDFs, etc.
